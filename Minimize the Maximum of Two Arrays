Minimize the Maximum of Two Arrays
Input: divisor1 = 2, divisor2 = 7, uniqueCnt1 = 1, uniqueCnt2 = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: 
We can distribute the first 4 natural numbers into arr1 and arr2.
arr1 = [1] and arr2 = [2,3,4].
We can see that both arrays satisfy all the conditions.
Since the maximum value is 4, we return it.

Note: binary search log(2_10 10)

class Solution:
    def minimizeSet(self, divisor1: int, divisor2: int, uniqueCnt1: int, uniqueCnt2: int) -> int:
        lcmr=math.lcm(divisor1,divisor2)
        l=0
        r=2**40-1
        def pos(m:int)->bool:
            c1=m-m//divisor1
            c2=m-m//divisor2
            totalc=m-m//lcmr
            return c1>=uniqueCnt1 and c2>=uniqueCnt2 and totalc>=uniqueCnt1+uniqueCnt2
        while l<r:
            m=(l+r)//2
            if pos(m):
                r=m
            else:
                l=m+1
        return l
